## Disclaimer:
The web build can be quite laggy sometimes, so I would recommend downloading for your OS. Also save files don't work on web build. Seriously the web build is basically just a preview. Use the binaries for your OS PLEASE.

PLEASE USE THE BUILDS FOR YOUR OS. 
## SOM Users:

It takes like 3 minutes to understand why this project is so cool, please don't rush it. (Also please use your native OS build instead of the web build)
